# 0.3

- Fixes [#48](https://github.com/AshFurrow/Moya/issues/48) that modifies Moya to execute completion blocks of stubbed responses *immediately*, instead of using `dispatch_async` to defer it to the next invocation of the run loop. **This is a breaking change**. Because of this change, the ReactiveCocoa extensions had to be modified slightly to deduplicate inflight stubbed requests. -[@ashfurrow](http://github.com/AshFurrow)

# 0.2

- Fixes [#44](https://github.com/AshFurrow/Moya/issues/44) where status codes weren't being pass through to completion blocks. This also modified the behaviour of the ReactiveCocoa extensions significantly but sending MoyaResponse objects instead of just NSData ones. —[@ashfurrow](http://github.com/AshFurrow)

# 0.1

- Initial release.
